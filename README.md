# movie-webapp

This web app has a similar user interface to NetFlix. The main reason behind building this web app is to implement a try data structure to give an autocomplete (suggestion) feature for the user, and in this web app we can filter movies by searching.(uses a searching algorithm).

**NOTE**
If you want to see the Netflix sliders and the similar UI of the Netflix app and want to build your own extended web app this project would be a good start.
In this app, I have added only 2 or 3 minute videos of every movie or webseries because I don't have cloud storage access to host every 2 or 3 GB of single videos.
